# CIFAR100---PySpark
Performed binary classification using PySpark

The CIFAR-100 dataset has 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 super classes. Each image comes with a "fine" label (the class to which it belongs) and a"coarse" label (the superclass to which it belongs).

The project is divided into 2 parts - Milestone 1 and Milestone 2

Milestone 1 - The goal is to perform a binary classification of images in vehicle 1 and vehicle 2 superclass pairs using PySpark.
